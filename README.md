# [WIP] XChain Address Derivation

Utility to derive addresses from a mnemonic phrase ([BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)) or keystore. Similar to [Iancoleman's Mnemonic Code Converter](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/), but using [xchain-*](https://github.com/xchainjs/xchainjs-lib) packages and for chain assets supported by [THORChain](https://thorchain.org) and [Maya](https://www.mayaprotocol.com) only. Currently ATOM, AVAX, BCH, BNB, BTC, DOGE, ETH, LTC, MAYA and RUNE.
